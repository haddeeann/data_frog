# Tensor Flow
## JavaScript or Python
On my journey.. I didn't know if Tensor Flow was a JavaScript library or based on Python.

It's JavaScript.

There we go. I was looking for something with Python and the command line. Like how do I just import a python library and start analyzing data from the command line and writing some Python code?

Answer so far? Not with Tensor Flow my friend.

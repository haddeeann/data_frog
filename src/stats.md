# Statistics
My notes on the Khan class that you can sign up for at [Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/). 

## Analyzing One Categorical Variable

### Identifying individuals, variables, and categorical variables in a data set.

When a question asks for individuals, it just means the things considering. The items of data we are analyzing. A variable in the context is like a category that we are distinguishing data about.

A categorical variable is a variable (thing we are talking about, analyzing) that is not measured in a number.

### Reading Pictographs

A pictograph is really a way to represent the data with pictures that show the amount of data in comparison.

Each of the pictures is going to represent an amount of something.

## Reading Bar Graphs

The bars will represent amounts of data being compared.

A two column bar graph will have data grouped in two columns each on the x-axis.

Comparing two sets of data is clear with a two column bar graph. Each bar of the two bars grouped together would represent a different set of data.

## Bar Charts: Central Tendency

We can look at a bar chart and find median (middle) value, by ordering the values and finding the center value.

The midrange of the scores is the mean of the highest and lowest values. It's the average of the highest and lowest values.

The average (mean) is found by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores.

To find the mode, you find the most common value.

To find the range, you find the difference between the highest and lowest score.

## Reading Pie Graphs

A pie graph is a diagram, a pie chart or graph (sometimes a circle graph). Each slice of the circle represents a percent of data out of a 100%.

Pie charts are a great way to easily visualize data in terms of percent, when talking about data that adds up to 100%.

# Two-way Tables

## Two-way frequency tables and Venn Diagrams

A two-way frequency table is a way to represent a venn diagram in a table format. Venn diagrams are good when you have sets of data with overlapping categorical data.

## Two-way relative frequency tables

# Data Frog

Welcome to Data Frog. My personal notes and learning journey for data science and machine learning.

## [NumPy](./numpy)
Installing NumPy can be done with pip:

`pip install numpy`

NumPy is a multidimensional library, meaning that you can have 1D, 2D or even more dimensions in the arrays. The benefit of using NumPy is that using Python lists are really slow. NumPy is much faster because they have fixed data types. NumPy uses less bytes of memory. Which also makes it faster.

NumPy uses contiguous memory as well.

To start using NumPy from the command line, start the command line. Then from there start using Python by entering:

`python`

That will put you in a Python environment. Then you can start using NumPy with:

`import numpy as np`

Then you have a numpy prompt and can start working inputting and manipulating arrays and data.

## [Statistics](./stats)

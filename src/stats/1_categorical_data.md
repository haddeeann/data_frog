## Individuals

In statistics, individuals refer to the objects described by a dataset. Each individual is often a person, but it could also be an animal, a thing, or even a time period, depending on the context of the study. In a dataset, each individual is usually represented by a row. For example, in a medical study, each individual might be a patient; in a sales report, each could be a transaction or a customer

## Variables

Variables are the characteristics or attributes that are measured, observed, or collected on each individual. In a dataset, these are typically represented as columns. There are two main types of variables: quantitative and qualitative (or categorical).

A quantitative variable is one that can be measured numerically, like height, age, or income. A qualitative (or categorical) variable describes a quality or characteristic, usually with words or categories, like gender, nationality, or brand preference.

## Categorical Variables

Categorical variables are a type of qualitative variable that categorizes or describes data. They take on values that are names or labels. The values of a categorical variable are typically discrete and fall into one or more categories or groups. For example, blood type (with categories like A, B, AB, O), color preference (like red, blue, green), or marital status (such as married, single, divorced) are categorical variables.

Categorical variables can be further classified as nominal or ordinal:

- Nominal Categorical Variables: These have two or more categories without any intrinsic order. For example, gender (male, female, non-binary) and country of origin are nominal.
- Ordinal Categorical Variables: These have a clear, ordered relationship between the categories. For example, education level (primary, secondary, tertiary) and customer satisfaction ratings (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied) are ordinal.


## Pictographs

A pictograph is a type of chart or graph that uses icons or symbols to represent data. Each icon or symbol in a pictograph represents a certain number of units. Pictographs are particularly useful for making data more relatable and easier to understand at a glance, especially for audiences that may not be familiar with more complex graph types. They are often used in settings like elementary education or in public communications where simplicity and immediate comprehension are key.

One downside is that they can lack precision and may not be suitable for more detailed or technical data analysis.

## Bar Graphs

Bar graphs are used to display and compare the frequency, count, or other measure (like mean) for different discrete categories or groups. In a bar graph, each category is represented by a bar, with the length or height of the bar proportional to the value or count of the category. Bar graphs can be drawn vertically (column chart) or horizontally (bar chart). They are particularly useful for comparing several groups or visualizing differences in quantities among categories.

## Pie Charts

Pie charts are circular statistical graphics divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions.
Each slice of the pie chart represents a category, and its size is proportional to the percentage or proportion of the category in the total dataset.
Pie charts are best used when you want to show parts of a whole, especially when each category is of a similar size.

## Central Tendency

Central tendency is a statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire set of data. It aims to provide a description of the entire dataset with just one value that represents the 'center' of its distribution.
The three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode:
Mean (Average): The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
Median: The middle value when all the data points are arranged in ascending order. If there’s an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two central numbers.
Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.
The choice of measure depends on the data’s distribution and nature. For example, the median is often used for skewed distributions, while the mean is suitable for normally distributed data.

## Pie Graphs

A pie graph is a diagram, a pie chart or graph (sometimes a circle graph). Each slice of the circle represents a percent of data out of a 100%.

Pie charts are a great way to easily visualize data in terms of percent, when talking about data that adds up to 100%.

## Two-Way Tables

Two-way tables, also known as contingency tables, are a method of displaying data that describes two different qualitative variables. These tables are organized with one variable along each axis, allowing for a straightforward visualization of the relationship between the two variables.

## Two-Way Frequency Tables

Two-way relative frequency tables show the proportion or percentage of each combination of variable categories, rather than just the count.

- **Purpose**: They are used to compare the relative frequencies of categories between different groups.
- **Example**: If you have a table of students by gender and grade level, a two-way relative frequency table could show the percentage of each gender within each grade level, or vice versa.

These tools are essential in data analysis for summarizing and identifying patterns in categorical data. They help in making informed decisions or hypotheses about the relationship between the variables being studied.

## Venn Diagrams

Venn diagrams are illustrations that use circles to show the relationships among sets or groups. Overlapping areas represent common elements between the sets.

- **Usefulness**: Venn diagrams are excellent for visualizing the similarities and differences between groups, making them useful in probability, logic, statistics, and set theory.

Algorithms are fun for their own sake. They can make you a much better developer, the same way the push-ups or squats can help you with daily activities. But in 'actual' development there is a lot more to it than the pure algorithm solving. Some topics that a software developer would need: system design, testing, environment set up, deployment, and artistic tools.

So system design is not something that I've delved into very much. But I've just heard at a senior level you will need.

Testing is both the real life concept that you want to be solving a real world problem and writing tests in code.

Environment set up is the idea that you'll need to know git, an i.d.e. and be able to install packages and do package management. No one writes code without building it on libraries from other programmers.

Deployment comes into play with knowing different deployment tools like AWS. If you work at a small enough company, it's important because it's your job. Working at a large company I imagine it's important for everyone to write code that is optimized at a production level. 

And artistic tools is what I'm calling working coming up with mockups and graphics. Sometimes that falls in the realm of the software developer.

<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
<h3>Identifying individuals, variables, and categorical variables in a data set.</h3>
<p>When a question asks for individuals, it just means the things considering. The items of data we are analyzing. A variable in the context is like a category that we are distinguishing data about.</p>
<p>A categorical variable is a variable (thing we are talking about, analyzing) that is not measured in a number.</p>

<h2>Analyzing One Categorical Variable</h2>
<h3>Identifying individuals, variables, and categorical variables in a data set.</h3>
<p>When a question asks for individuals, it just means the things considering. The items of data we are analyzing. A variable in the context is like a category that we are distinguishing data about.</p>
<p>A categorical variable is a variable (thing we are talking about, analyzing) that is not measured in a number.</p>
<h3>Reading Pictographs</h3>
<p>A pictograph is really a way to represent the data with pictures that show the amount of data in comparison.</p>
<p>Each of the pictures is going to represent an amount of something.</p>
<h2>Reading Bar Graphs</h2>
<p>The bars will represent amounts of data being compared.</p>
<p>A two column bar graph will have data grouped in two columns each on the x-axis.</p>
<p>Comparing two sets of data is clear with a two column bar graph. Each bar of the two bars grouped together would represent a different set of data.</p>
<h2>Bar Charts: Central Tendency</h2>
<p>We can look at a bar chart and find median (middle) value, by ordering the values and finding the center value.</p>
<p>The midrange of the scores is the mean of the highest and lowest values. It's the average of the highest and lowest values.</p>
<p>The average (mean) is found by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores.</p>
<p>To find the mode, you find the most common value.</p>
<p>To find the range, you find the difference between the highest and lowest score.</p>
<h2>Reading Pie Graphs</h2>
<p>A pie graph is a diagram, a pie chart or graph (sometimes a circle graph). Each slice of the circle represents a percent of data out of a 100%.</p>
<p>Pie charts are a great way to easily visualize data in terms of percent, when talking about data that adds up to 100%.</p>
<h1>Two-way Tables</h1>
<h2>Two-way frequency tables and Venn Diagrams</h2>
<p>A two-way frequency table is a way to represent a venn diagram in a table format. Venn's diagrams are good when you have sets of data with overlapping categorical data.</p>
<h2>Two-way relative frequency tables</h2>

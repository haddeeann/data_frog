    <h1>IO with NumPy</h1>
    <main>

<p><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.io.genfromtxt.html#defining-the-input">using genfromtxt</a></p>
<p>There are several ways NumPy can create arrays from tabular data. <code>genfromtxt</code> is one such useful way.</p>
<p>In a nutshell the <code>genfromtxt</code> runs two main loops. The first loop converts each line of the file.</p>
<p>The second loop converts each string to the right data type.</p>
<p>the mechanism of using two loops take more time but it gives more flexibility.</p>
<p>The only mandatory argument of <code>genfromtxt</code> is the data source. It can be a string, a list of strings or a file read into NumPy.</p>
<p>If a single string is given, then it's assumed to be the name of a local or remote file.</p>
<p>If a list of string is given then each string is treated as one line of a file. When the URL of a remote file is passed the file is automatically downloaded to the current directory and opened.</p>
<p>The different types of archives recognized are gzip and dbz2. If the file extension is '.gz' then a gzip is expected. If it ends with a 'bz2' then a bzip2 file is assumed.</p>
<h2>Splitting the lines into columns</h2>
<p>Once the file if open for reading the 'genfromtxt' splits each line to a sequence of strings. Whatever delimiter is chosen will split the characters into lines. That can be a comma (,) semicolon (;) or even the '\t' - the tab character.</p>
<p>The delimiter chosen isn't limited to a single character. Also, the file may be fixed width. Then the columns are going to be defined as a given number of characters. By default, the white spacing at the end and beginning of values are not stripped. But a parameter of autostrip can be set to True and the leading and trailing white spaces will be stripped from the values.</p>
<p>Comments from the files will be ignored from processing and comment s are marked with a #.</p>
<h2>Skipping Lines and choosing columns</h2>
<p>Once the file is defined and open for reading the <code>genfromtxt</code> splits each non-empty line into a sequence of string.</p>
<p>The delimiter keyword is used to define how the splitting should take place. Most of the time, a single delimiter will mark the separation. Like with CSV, comma separated values it can use a comma or semicolon as a delimiter. The tab character, the '\t' is another common separator. However, it doesn't have to be a single character, any string of characters will do.</p>
<p>From default settings, <code>genfromtxt</code> assumes a delimiter=None. This separates values along white spaces. Consecutive white spaces are considered as a single white space.</p>
<p>Instead, we could have a fixed width file. That's where the columns are defined as a given number of characters. If so, we set the delimiter to either a single integer or a sequence of integers (if the columns have a different size).</p>
<p>Leading and trailing white space characters are not stripped automatically. That can be overwritten by passing in an optional argument to a value of True.</p>
<p>By default, the character that signifies comments is the '#'. But that can be changed to a different character by passing in the comment argument. Any character passed in as such will then become the marker for comments in the code.</p>
<p>If we have a header or footer in the file, we can skip those lines by using the <code>skip_header</code> or <code>skip_footer</code> arguments.</p>
<p>If we want to use only some of the columns and not all of the data, we can pass in the <code>usecols</code> argument. That argument can take a single argument or a sequence of integers. The columns indices begin at zero. If the columns have names you can use the column names instead.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Data Type</h2>
<p>You can choose how the data is imported, that is what type of data it's imported as by setting the dtype argument. Some dtypes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>a single type, like <code>dtype=float</code></li>
<li>a sequence of types, such as <code>dtype=(int, float, float)</code></li>
<li>a comma separated string, like <code>dtype=&quot;i4, f8, |U3&quot;</code></li>
<li>a dictionary with two keys, 'names' and 'formats'</li>
<li>a sequence of types (name, type), such as dtype=[('A', int), ('B', float)]</li>
<li>an existing data type object</li>
<li>the special value of None</li>
</ol>
<p>In all the above cases, except the data type object or the special value of None will create a 1D array with structured dtype. This has as many fields as items in the sequence. The field names are defined with the names keyword.</p>
<p>When the dtype is None the type of each column is determined iteratively from the data itself. In order, NumPy checks if a string can be converted to a boolean, then whether it can be converted to an integer, the to a float, then to a complex, then eventually just a string.</p>
<p>The dtype=None is significantly slower.</p>

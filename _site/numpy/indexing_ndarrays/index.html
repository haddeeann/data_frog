<h1>Indexing</h1>
<p>The <code>ndarrays</code> can be indexed using the stand Python object x[obj] syntax, same as normal dictionary access notation. There's different kinds of indexing available depending on the object. There is basic indexing and advanced indexing, and field access.</p>
<h2>Basic and single element indexing</h2>
<p>the single element indexing work the same as in other standard Python sequences. It's 0-based and accepts negative indices to reference from the end of an array.</p>
<p>A single <code>ndarray</code> can be turned into a multidimentional array.</p>
<p><code>x = n.arange(10) x.shape(2, 5) x[1, 3] 8</code></p>
<p>The opposite can be said. Accessing a multidimensional array with one dimensional access reduces it and a subdimensional array is returned.</p>
<p><code>x[0] array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])</code></p>
<p>The returned array is a view, it's not a copy of the original but point to the exact same values in memory as the original array.</p>
<p>The syntax <code>x[0, 2] == x[0][2]</code> is equivalent. The second syntax created a new temporary array after the first index that is subsequently indexed by 2.</p>
<h2>Slicing and Striding</h2>
<p>The basic slicing extends Python's basic concept of slicing to the N dimensions. Basic slicing occurs when the obj is a slice object.</p>
<p>It works like slicing an array in Python with start:stop:step notation in the brackets.</p>
<p>The <code>ellipses</code> and <code>newaxis</code> objects can be in this notation as well as integers. The simplest way of indexing with N integers returns an array scalar representing a corresponding item.</p>
<p>In NumPy there are 24 fundamental Python types to describe the different types of scalars.</p>
<p>All the rules of slicing sequences in Python apply on a per dimension basis.</p>
<p>The basics are that <code>i:j:k</code> will step through the array where i starts, j ends, and k is the step amount through the array where k != 0. that is, k can not equal zero.</p>
<h2>Dimensional indexing tools</h2>
<p>The ellipsis is a tool to help with matching the array shapes with expressions in an assignment.</p>
<p>There can be only one ellipsis present in slicing. The length of the expanded selection tuple is <code>x.ndim</code></p>
<p>Each <code>newaxis</code> object in the selection tuple serves to expand the dimensions of the the result by one unit length dimension.</p>
<h2>Importing data with <code>genfromtxt</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.io.genfromtxt.html#defining-the-input">using genfromtxt</a></p>
<p>There are several ways NumPy can create arrays from tabular data. <code>genfromtxt</code> is one such useful way.</p>

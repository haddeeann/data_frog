<h2>Learning NumPy with FreeCodeCamp</h2>
<p>Welcome to Data Frog. My personal notes and learning journey for data science and machine learning.</p>
<h2>Start</h2>
<p>NumPy is a multidimensional library. Why use NumPy over Lists.</p>
<p>The main benefit is speed. Native Python Lists are slow. But, NumPy is faster because it uses a fixed type for the data.</p>
<p>Computer see binary when they are looking at data. For example, the number 5 would be binary form. And NumPy would cast it to an Int32 format.</p>
<p>But you can specify to a single byte that would be Int8.</p>
<p>But with Lists, you'd need to store a lot more things with Python. Internally each List consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sizes</li>
<li>Reference Count</li>
<li>Object Type</li>
<li>Object Value</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you break it up into the bits that are stored it takes a lot more space to store even a single value in the List. So, in summary because NumPy uses less bytes of memory, so it's faster.</p>
<p>It's also faster because you don't need type checking with objects.</p>
<p>NumPy also uses contiguous memory. Where Lists don't need to be stored in contiguous memory. That makes it faster for the computer to access the NumPy data.</p>
<p>With list of data in Python, the storage in memory is actually just pointing to pointers in memory.</p>

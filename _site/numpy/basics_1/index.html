<h2>Basics of NumPy</h2>
<h3>Array Creation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Conversion from other Python structures</li>
<li>The built in NumPy array creation functions</li>
<li>By replicating, joining or mutating existing arrays</li>
<li>Reading arrays from disk, either standard or custom formats</li>
<li>From raw bytes thru the use of strings or buffers</li>
<li>Special library functions, like random</li>
</ol>
<h4>Making Arrays from Python sequences</h4>
<p>The NumPy arrays can be made from lists and tuples. Lists are as [...] and tuples (...).</p>
<ul>
<li>a list will make a 1D array</li>
<li>a list of list will create a 2D array</li>
<li>any further nested will create higher dimension arrays. The array objects dimension is represented by the concept of ndarray in NumPy.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using a <code>numpy.array</code> to make an array it's important to be careful of the dtype or the data type of the array. It's important to not have an overflow. For example, and 8-bit signed integer represents a number from -128 to 127. So if you tried to assign a number like 128 or 129 to a dtype=np.int8.</p>
<p>When performing operations with two arrays with the same type (dtype) of uint32, for example, the resulting array is hte same type.</p>
<p>When performing operations that different dtypes, NumPy will assign a new type that satisfies all the array elements involved in the computation. For example, uint32 and int32 can be both represented by int64.</p>
<p>The default behavior is to create arrays as either 32 or 64 bit signed integers depending on the platform. Or even a double precision floating point number like int32/int64. If you want a specific type otherwise you need to specify the type.</p>
<h4>Built in NumPy array creation functions</h4>
<p>There are over 40 built-in functions for creating arrays. There are 3 broad categories of array creator functions.</p>
<ol>
<li>1D arrays</li>
<li>2D arrays</li>
<li>ndarrays (more than two dimensions)</li>
</ol>
<h5>1D Arrays</h5>
<p>For 1D or 1 dimension arrays there's <code>numpy.linspace</code> and <code>numpy.arange</code>. Generally there needs to be at least two inputs start and stop.</p>
<p>The <code>numpy.arange</code> creates arrays with regular incrementing values. Best use in <code>numpy.arange</code> is to use a start, end, and step. And if you want to use a non-integer incrementor / step you want to use a <code>dtype</code> of float.</p>
<h5>2D Arrays</h5>

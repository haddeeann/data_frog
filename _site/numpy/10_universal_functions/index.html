<h2>Universal Functions</h2>
<p>A universal function (or a ufunc for short) is a function that operates on ndarrays in an element by element fashion.</p>
<p>This supports array broadcasting, type casting, and several other features.</p>
<h2>Ufunc methods</h2>
<p>All ufuncs have four methods. These methods only make sense on scalar ufuncs that take tow input arguments and return one output argument.</p>
<p>Attempting to call these methods on other ufuncs will case a ValueError.</p>
<p>The reduce like methods all take an axis keyword, a dtype keyword, and an out keyword, and the arrays must all have the dimension &gt;= 1.</p>
<p>The axis keyword specifies the axis of the array over whihc the reduction will take place.</p>
<p>Generally, it is an integer, though for <code>numpy.ufunc.reduce</code>, it can also be a tupe of an int to reduce over several axes at once, or None, to reduce over all axes.</p>
<p>The dtype keyword allows you to manage a very common problem that arises when naively using <code>ufunc.reduce</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may have an array of a certain data type and wish to add up all of it's elements, but the result does not fit into the data type of the array.</p>
<p>This commonly happens if you have an array of single-byte integers.</p>
<p>The dtype keyword allows you to alter the data type over which the reduction takes place.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can ensure that the output is the datatype with the precision large enough to handle your output. The responsibility of altering the reduce type is mostly up to you.</p>
<p>There's one exception, if no dtype is given for a reduction ont eh 'add' or 'multiply' operations, then if the input type is an integer or boolean type and it's smaller than the size of the <code>nupy.itn_</code> data type, it will be internally upcast to the <code>int_ or </code>numpy.uint` data-type.</p>

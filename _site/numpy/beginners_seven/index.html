        <h2>Math Formulas</h2>
        <p>One of the good things about working with NumPy that makes it so useful is being able to work with mathematical formulas. You can use formulas that work on arrays.</p>
        <p>Statics is a great use case and the mean square formula is an often used formula in supervised machine leaning models that deal with regression.</p>
        <p>Using this formula with number might go something like this:</p>
        `error = (1/n) * np.sum(np.square(predictions - labels))`
        <p>Predictions and labels can be any size, small to large. As long as they are the same size as each other.</p>

<h2>Array Creation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Conversion from other Python structures, like lists and tuples</li>
<li>The built-in NumPy array creation functions</li>
<li>By replicating, joining or mutating existing arrays</li>
<li>Reading arrays from disk, either standard or custom formats</li>
<li>From raw bytes through the use of strings or buffers</li>
<li>Special library functions</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use these methods to create ndarrays or Structured arrays.</p>
<p>Structured arrays are ndarrays whose datatype is a composition of simpler datatypes.</p>
<p>These simpler datatypes are organized as a sequence of named fields.</p>
<p><code>x = np.array(['Bob' 9, 110], dtype=[('firstname', 'U10'), ('age', 'i4'), ('weight', 'f4')])</code></p>
<p>x is a one dimensional array. The length of the array is two. The datatype is a structure with three fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>a string of length 10 or less, named 'firstname'</li>
<li>a 32 bit integer named 'age'</li>
<li>a 32 bit float, named 'weight'</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conversion from other Python structures</h2>
<p>The NumPy arrays can be made from lists and tuples. Lists are as [...] and tuples (...).</p>
<p>A list of numbers will create a 1D array. To create a 2D array, you can use a list of lists. If you want to create higher dimensional arrays you can nest lists even further.</p>
<p>An easy way to create an array from a list or tuple is with the <code>np.array</code> function.</p>
<p><code>one_dimensional_array = np.array([127, 182, 100])</code></p>
<p>You can specify the data type of the information in the NumPy arrays, by adding a parameter of the dtype. If you don't pass in a data type (dtype) then it will assign a default dtype.</p>
<p>If the data in the array is outside what is available for that type you can end up with an overflow on the data.</p>
<p>For example, an 8-bit signed integer represents a number from -128 to 127. So if you tried to assign a number like 128 or 129 to a <code>dtype=np.int8</code>, you'd have an overflow. This is because an 8-bit signed integer can only represent numbers from -128 to 127.</p>
<p><code>overflow_array = np.array([127, 128, 129], dtype=np.int8) overflow_array array([127, -128, -127], dtype=int8)</code></p>
<p>When performing operations with two arrays with the same data type the resulting array is the same data type.</p>
<p>When performing operations that different data types, NumPy will assign a new type that satisfies all the array elements involved in the computation.</p>
<p>The default behavior is to create arrays as either 32 or 64 bit signed integers depending on the platform. Or even a double precision floating point number like int32/int64.</p>
<p>If you want a specific data type in the result, it's best to specify the data type.</p>
<h2>Built in NumPy array creation functions</h2>
<p>There are over 40 built-in functions for creating arrays.</p>
<p>There are 3 broad categories of array creator functions. In general, the categories are based on how many dimensions the resulting array is.</p>
<ol>
<li>1D arrays</li>
<li>2D arrays</li>
<li>ndarrays (more than two dimensions)</li>
</ol>
<h2>1D Arrays</h2>
<p>For  one dimension arrays there's <code>numpy.linspace</code> and <code>numpy.arange</code>. Both of these functions use the two inputs: start and stop.</p>
<p>The <code>numpy.arange</code> creates arrays with regular incrementing values. The best practice for <code>numpy.arange</code> is to use an integer start, end, and step values. The step values indicates the spacing between values.</p>
<p>Smaller or more precise start, end, and step values can be used with float data type inputs. In order to do that an array can be created with the dtype of float.</p>
<p>The <code>numpy.linspace</code> will create arrays with a specified number of elements. They will be spaced equally between the specific beginning and end values. They're spaced according to the third input, the number of values to generate.</p>
<p>The difference? The <code>numpy.linspace</code> allows you to specify the number of steps. The <code>numpy.arange</code> allows you to specify the size of the steps.</p>
<h2>2D Arrays</h2>
<p>The 2D array creation functions are <code>numpy.eye</code>, <code>numpy.diag</code>, and <code>numpy.vander</code>.</p>
<h3>numpy.eye</h3>
<p>And example of using the <code>numpy.eye</code> creation process is <code>np.eye(n, m)</code>.</p>
<p>The eye tool returns a 2D array with 1's as the diagonal and 0's elsewhere. If only one parameter is passed in, then it's used to make the length of each array and the number of arrays.</p>
<p>If both n and m parameters are passed in then the n parameter is the number of rows. And the m parameter is the length of each row.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>np.eye(3) array([[1., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 1.]]) np.eye(3, 5) array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 1., 0., 0.]])</code></p>
<h3>numpy.diag</h3>
<p>The <code>numpy.diag</code> can be used to define a 2D array with the given values along the diagonal. You can pass two parameters, an input array and k. The k is an integer and it's value decides the main diagonal.</p>
<p>If k is positive, then the diagonal is above the main diagonal. And if k is negative then the diagonal is below the main diagonal.</p>
<p>Or if the input array is a 2D array, it returns a 1D array that is only the diagonal elements.</p>
<p>The <code>numpy.eye</code> and <code>numpy.diag</code> functions can be helpful for doing linear algebra.</p>
<p><code>np.diag([1, 2, 3]) array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3]]) np.diag([1, 2, 3], 1) array([[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0]]) a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) np.diag(a) array([1, 4])</code></p>
<h3>numpy.vander</h3>
<p>The <code>vander(x, n)</code> defines a Vendermonde matrix as a 2D NumPy array.</p>
<p>Each column of the Vandemonde matrix is a decreasing power of the input. That is the 1D array (the list or tuple) that was passed in to make the matrix.</p>
<p>The <code>x</code> being where the highest polynomial order as is <code>n-1</code>. This array creation routine is useful in generating linear least square models.</p>
<p><code>np.vander(np.linspace(0, 2, 5), 2) array([[0. , 1. ], [0.5, 1. ], [1. , 1. ], [1.5, 1. ], [2. , 1. ]]) np.vander([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) array([[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]]) np.vander((1, 2, 3, 4), 4) array([[ 1,  1,  1,  1], [ 8,  4,  2,  1], [27,  9,  3,  1], [64, 16,  4,  1]])</code></p>
<h2>general ndarray creation function</h2>
<p>To create an ndarry with filled in values, you can use <code>numpy.ones</code>, <code>numpy.zeroes</code>, and <code>random</code>. These all fill the created arrays with various values depending on which you use. These arrays create any dimension of arrays by specifying how how dimensions or length along a tuple or list.</p>
<p>The <code>numpy.zeros</code> will craete an array filled with zeroes. The default dtype is <code>float64</code>. The <code>numpy.ones</code> will create an array filled with the value of 1. The <code>random</code> method will fill the array with random numbers between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>The <code>numpy.indices</code> will create a set of arrays. They will be stacked as a one-higher dimensioned array. This is useful for evaluating functions of multiple dimensions on a regular grid.</p>
<h2>Replicating, joining or mutation existing arrays</h2>
<p>One arrays have been created you can replicate, join, or mutate those existing arrays to make new arrays.</p>
<p>If you assign an array to a new variable, the original array is edited when the new array is edited.</p>
<p>To do otherwise, make a new array that doesn't change the original array, use <code>numpy.copy</code>. Here is an example of an array that gets edited after being passed.</p>
<p><code>a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) b = a[:2] b += 1 print('a = ', a) print('b = ', b) a = [2 3 3 4 5 6] b = [2 3]</code></p>
<p>Here's an example of how when you copy an array it doens't change the original.</p>
<p><code>a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) b = a[:2].copy() b += 1 print('a = ', a) print('b = ', b) a = [1 2 3 4] b = [2 3]</code></p>
<p>Some other routines that can be used to join existing arrays: <code>numpy.vstack</code>, <code>numpy.hstack</code>, and <code>numpy.block</code>.</p>
<h2>Reading Arrays from Disk</h2>
<p>This is the most common case for creating large arrays is from existing data.</p>
<h3>Standard Binary Formats</h3>
<p>Various fields have stand formats for the array data.</p>
<p>HD5: h5py
FITS: Astropy</p>
<p>Some formats cannot be read directly, but those can be converted to a format supported by libraries like PIL.</p>
<h3>Common ASCII Formats</h3>
<p>Files such as csv and tsv files are delimited data. Those type of files that can be opened with programs like Excel and LabView. the two standard routines for importing a file with delimted data is <code>numpy.loadtxt</code> and <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code>. Other ways of importing data are <code>scipy.ioFf</code> and <code>Pandas</code>.</p>
<h2>Creating Arrays from raw bytes</h2>
<p>If the file has a relatively simple format then a simple I/O library can be written that used the NumPy <code>fromfile()</code> function and the <code>.tofile()</code> methods to read and write to NumPy arrays directly.</p>
<h2>Other libraries</h2>
<p>NumPy is a fundamental library where other libraries can be added ona dn used. Some of the libraries are SciPy, Pandas, and OpenCV.</p>

<h2>Some Copy Pasta</h2>
<h3>I heard you like carbs</h3>
<h3>Anaconda</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>
What is it? looks like a data science platform. Meaning it's a program where you can run all the code. A bit like an IDE I guess. Except for data science instead of just code.</p>
<h3>Pandas</h3>
<p><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>
For data wrangling and data manipulation because it allows a user to read data in, change it, look for missing values, read data out. The Pandas library is one of the most popular and easy-to-use libraries available. It allows for easy manipulation of tabular data for data cleaning and data analysis.</p>
<h3>NumPy</h3>
<p><a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>
I think I struck gold here.</p>
<p>For fast computation because it speeds up all of the different calculations that you're doing. Pandas actually uses NumPy under the hood for some of its calculations! NumPy is a Python library that provides support for many mathematical tasks on large, multidimensional arrays and matrices.</p>
<h3>Matplotlib</h3>
<p>For data visualizations. The most common ones will both be able to help you produce some nice visuals. This library provides simple ways to create static or interactive boxplots, scatterplots, line graphs, and bar charts. It’s useful for simplifying your data visualization tasks.</p>
<h3>Seaborn</h3>
<p>Seaborn is another data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that allows for visually appealing statistical graphs. It allows you to easily visualize beautiful confidence intervals, distributions, and other graphs.</p>
<h3>Statsmodels</h3>
<p>This statistical modeling library builds all of your statistical models and statistical tests including linear regression, generalized linear models, and time series analysis models.</p>
<h3>Scipy</h3>
<p>Scipy is a library used for scientific computing that helps with linear algebra, optimization, and statistical tasks.
Requests: This is a useful library for scraping data from websites. It provides a user-friendly and responsive way to configure HTTP requests.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning Libraries</h2>
<h3>Scikit-learn</h3>
<p><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-learn</a>
This popular machine learning library is a one-stop-shop for all of your machine learning needs with support for both supervised and unsupervised tasks. Some of the machine learning algorithms available are logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, k-means, DBSCAN, and principal component analysis.</p>
<p>For machine learning because it has all of the algorithms you'll want to use for regression, classification, and unsupervised learning. When you’re deep in the Immersive Data Science Bootcamp, you’ll be leveraging Scikit-Learn pretty heavily.</p>
<h3>Tensorflow</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensor Flow</a></p>
<h5>JavaScript</h5>
<p>Tensorflow is a high-level library for building neural networks. Since it was mostly written in C++, this library provides us with the simplicity of Python without sacrificing power and performance. However, working with raw Tensorflow is not suited for beginners.</p>
<h3>Keras</h3>
<h5>JavaScript</h5>
<p>Keras is a popular high-level API that acts as an interface for the Tensorflow library. It’s a tool for building neural networks using a Tensorflow backend that’s extremely user friendly and easy to get started with.</p>
<h3>Pytorch</h3>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a></p>
<h5>Python</h5>
<p>Um, I mean, it better be right? Because it's kinda in the name.
Pytorch is another framework for deep learning created by Facebook’s AI research group. It provides more flexibility and speed than Keras, but since it has a low-level API, it is more complex and may be a little bit less beginner friendly than Keras.</p>

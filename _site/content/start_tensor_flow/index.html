<h2>JavaScript or Python</h2>
<p>On my journey.. I didn't know if Tensor Flow was a JavaScript library or based on Python.</p>
<p>It's JavaScript.</p>
<p>There we go. I was looking for something with Python and the command line. Like how do I just import a python library and start analyzing data from the command line and writing some Python code?</p>
<p>Answer so far? Not with Tensor Flow my friend.</p>
